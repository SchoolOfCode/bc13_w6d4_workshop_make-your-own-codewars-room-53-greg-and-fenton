/* Holiday vs Armageddon
INSTRUCTIONS
A meteor is heading for earth. NASA has a team of meteor-fighting, expert oil-drilling astronauts in their department to fight this meteor. The problem is, some have booked holiday. We need to figure out what day of the week this holiday is booked upon. 
The days of the week are represented as numbers like this:
Monday = 1,
Tuesday = 2,
Wednesday = 3,
Thursday = 4,
Friday = 5,
Saturday = 6,
Sunday = 7

Given a number between 1 - 7 representing the current day, and another number representing the amount of days in the future our oil-drilling astronauts go on holiday, return a number between 1 - 7 that represents the day upon which they go away.

For instance:
John knows that on Wednesday (3) his holiday is 10458 days in the future.
So findTheFutureDayOfTheWeek(3, 10460) should return 5 (i.e. Friday)

Clare knows that on Sat (6) her holiday is 132 days in the future.
So findTheFutureDayOfTheWeek(6, 131) should return 4 (i.e Thursday)

NOTE: You shall only ever be given positive whole integers (no decimal points, no negative numbers or anything numbers) for the futureAmountOfDays so you do not need to worry about any validation.

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
function findTheFutureDayOfTheWeek(currentDay, futureAmountOfDays) { 
    return theFutureDayOfTheWeek;
}


export default findTheFutureDayOfTheWeek;
